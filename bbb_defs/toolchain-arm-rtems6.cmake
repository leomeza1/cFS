# This example toolchain file describes the cross compiler to use for
# the target architecture indicated in the configuration file.

# In this sample application, the cross toolchain is configured to
# use a compiler for the RTEMS operating system targeting the "pc686" BSP

# Note that to use this, the "RTEMS" platform module may need to be added
# to the system-wide CMake installation as a default CMake does not yet
# recognize RTEMS as a system name.  An example of this is distributed with
# the pc-rtems PSP.
